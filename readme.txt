If you need to export specific pages with attachement, you should use this plugin.

== Description ==

This is <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/themeton">ThemeTon</a> and we sell premium themes on ThemeForest.net. Most of the time people want to get specific home page and few pages on their site instead of full demo site content.
But it's hard to separate requested page content with attachement for them everytime and I've developed this simple plugin.

Main functionality depends on WP core function and added slight modification. You can export a page or multiple pages to a xml file as regular WordPress export function.
Then you can import your exported file for WP importer plugin.
